  <P> Today, we started by using tinkercad, where we looked at the different components basic circits and what they. In addition, I learned how to use a circit and ensure that it functions as it is supposed to. Prior to this class, I never really made circuits before, or went in debth about the specific parts. However, I was familiar with the calculations of ohms because in my freshman year, I took Physics and we used Ohm's Law at times. That being said, I was very excited to try building advanced circuits. <P>

  <P>We then downloaded Arduino to help the circuit blink. Regarding Arduino, I learned that it is important to have the correct boards selected; if not, you won't be able to properly use the circit to its full potential and exert its intended function. I was not able to actually build the circit and make the LED light blink, using Arduino, because I needed a USB-C plug for my comuter, and did not have one. Nevertheless, I was able to order one and build the circuit, with the help of tinkercad.<P>

  <P> Here it is... <P>

<P> I was very amused at the fact that I was able to build this, even though it was simple. And the light changed colors? Yeah, that was the icing on the cake.. lol :)
<P>


<P> After that, I sort of struggled to use the multimeter because I wasnt sure where I should attach the cords. However, I watched some videos and kind of got the hang of it.
