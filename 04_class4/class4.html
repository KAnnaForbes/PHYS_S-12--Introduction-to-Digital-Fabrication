        <p> Regarding today's assignment, I was conflicted with whether I wanted to to a kinetic sculpture or a mini final project because I kind of thought the mini final project would be a little too hard. Anyways, I found that the kinetic sculpture would have been harder, not because I didn't have the ability to do it, but because I had no clue where to start! I then figured that it would have been more beneficial to me to do the mini final project idea so it would be easier to do my actual final project. So, drawing machine it is! <p>

          <P> I started by cutting out a triangle from a piece of cardboard with four holes, one in each corner for each of the colored pencils and one in the center for the motor. <P>

        <P> After that, I placed the the colored pencils into the cardboard, along with the moter and hotglued them.

        <P>I ended up having to remake the board using the process above because I made the hole for the motor too big. In addition, I attached a hub to the end of the motor since the "machine" did ot turn at all. <P>

         <P> After that, I just connected the motor to the metro board.<P>

          <P> Although I did get the actual motor to move, the drawing machine still hasn't turned without my help. But, I'm working on it!! <P>
