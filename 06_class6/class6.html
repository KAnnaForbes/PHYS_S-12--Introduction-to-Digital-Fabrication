        <p> For today's assignment, I decided to use the app "Qlone" for 3D Scanning. I picked this one beacuse it was one of the first applications where I was actually able to use my back camera. For this app, I had to print out a specific mat that was needed in order to scan the object placed on it. <P>

        <P> To begin, I picked a a small toy and placed it in a standing position on the mat. <P> 

        <img src="./IMG_0281.JPG" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:100%" alt="">

      <P> After that, I began to sacn the toy. And this is how it came out.<P>

          <img src="./IMG_8664.jpg" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:100%" alt="">

        <P> I did not like the outcome of my first scan at all. I felt as though part of the reason that the scan did not turn out so good was because it fell over, even after I used tape to try to secure it. I then decided that I wanted to try again. But this time, I changed the toy into a sitting position so it would remain more balanced than before. I still used tape though, just in case ;) <P>

         <P> Changing the position really helped, as I was very satisfied with the new outcome.

   <h4>3D Design With Fusion 360 </h4> <br> 
 <P> For this portion of the assignment, I chose the option to make an object that could not be easily made by subtractive methods. That said, I started by making a water bottle. <P>

<P> In the middle of doing this, I wanted to build something else, so I decided to make a a small trash basket <P>
