       <P> For today's assignment, be sasically just had to record our progress toward our final project.<P>
        <P> So to start, I started building the base for my drawing machine so it can be "portable" in a way. (I made a base with pieces of card coard stacked onto each other so that it will be easier for me to attach the stepper motors and the dawing paper.) <P>

        <P> I ended up changing my mind and decided to use a shoe box instead. So, I painted the show box and gave it some designs.<P>

        <P> Then, I added the stepper motors, and the pen/ pencil holder (has servo motor attached). Following that, I added the strings to the holder and strung it around the steppers.<P>
          <img src="./2.jpg" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:100%" alt="">
          <P>Then after that, I added three batteries to each string to act as a weight.<P>

          <P> Here's my circuit.<P>
