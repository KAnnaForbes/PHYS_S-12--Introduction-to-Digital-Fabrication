        <P> In today's class, we learned how to progeam a LED light using a computer. I was really excited for this because I thought that I=it was one step closer to using vioce control for my project. However, I found out that it was a bit too late for that and we wouldn't have had enough time. :(<P>
          <P> Nevertheless, I was able to program the LED light using the IP address from my WiFi. At first, it was a stuggle because my port to arduino kept getting disconnected and I just couldn't get the IP address to load. Nevertheless, I was able to get everything connected and working.<P>
          <P> Here's a short video of me controlling the LED from my computer:<P>

        <P> After that, I worked on my 3D model for the pencil holder in mt final project a bit more. I kind of had to rush this because as said before, it was getting late in the program and I was a little behind on my model due to outside issues. But here it is!
