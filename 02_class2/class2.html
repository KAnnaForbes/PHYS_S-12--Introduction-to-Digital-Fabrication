  <h3>Class 2: 2D Design and Cutting </h3> <br> 
  <div >
    
<p> Today I was introduced to many different machines used to cut different materials. Although I'm kind of bumbed that I won't get a chnace to use most of the materials in person, I'm still excited to see how they work. <p>


    <h4>Fusion 360 </h4> <br> 

    <p> I was also introduced to the Fusion 360 software and it was interesting to see how you can make 3D sketches and piece things together. Fusion 360 took some time to download and get access, but I was still kind of ecited to see what I could make!

          <p> Here's A Bolt <p> 
            <img src="./bolt.png" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:100%" alt="...">

            <p> So far in fusion 360, I've learned how to properly create different 3D figures as well as 2D figures. However, I struggled with putting the revolutions on the bolt to get that sort of round surface. But I think I will get the hang of it the more I use it!
